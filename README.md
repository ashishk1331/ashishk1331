### AshishK is mad!
😎 I know I've over-used that line but let me use it this one more time!<br />
👋 Hello fellas!<br />
😉 My name is Ashish Khare and I love to live on the dirty side of the web planet, aka the javascript tooling world.<br />
🍃 I center my life around topics like VDOM, notion data typing, and of course tailwind. <br />
👀 Recently, I started building libraries like Avvvatars. Soon I'll tell you more. <br />
🐦 I mostly stay awake at [Twitter Inc.](https://twitter.com/AshishK1331) <br />

The stack that I use to create my projects includes:
1️⃣ Javascript, Python
2️⃣ Next.js/Vite.js + Framer Motion
3️⃣ Zustand
4️⃣ Tailwind CSS
5️⃣ Supabase/Firebase
6️⃣ React Testing Library
7️⃣ ShadCN UI/ Radix UI

👟 Well, I know a lot of things and learning more. So, follow me to be a part of my journey.
