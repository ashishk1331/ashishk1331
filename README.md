## AshishK is mad.

Three things I enjoy building,

1. Frontend Systems
2. Generative Adversarial Network
3. Mobile Apps

For the past six years, I've been working with frontend technologies like ReactJS and learning design patterns with JavaScript, now using TypeScript. I've built Tetrapack (a Notion page renderer), folder-routing (a framework to serve JSON files as API endpoints, much like json-server), and have done a lot of web scraping using Python.

My current tech stack includes:
- Typescript, Python
- Next.js/Vite.js + Framer Motion
- Zustand
- Tailwind CSS/ ShadCN UI/ Radix UI
- Supabase/Firebase
- React Testing Library
